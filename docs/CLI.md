## nova-sprint

Coordinate tasks across your AI team, from the queue through review and landing.

The store remembers cards, assignments, reviews, and merge state. Each tick
assigns ready work to members with capacity, sends finished work to readers,
and queues approved results for merging. An AI coordinator can handle the
inbox and keep work moving while the human is away. The exact rules are in
[SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md).

### First run

For a guided version with an isolated scratch directory and every step through
landing, use [the local first lap](FIRST-LAP.md).

Try one card's whole flow with no Redis or git. `--redis mem:<file>` (or
`NOVA_SPRINT_REDIS=mem:<file>`) loads an in-memory twin from a file and saves it
after each command. A twin is for learning and tests; run one command at a
time. The first line sets the store and actor. `finish` without `--head` and
`merge` stand in for a worker's pushed commit and its landing, so this flow
needs no forge:

```sh
export NOVA_SPRINT_REDIS=mem:sprint.twin NOVA_SPRINT_ACTOR=boss
nova-sprint init --readers reader-a,reader-b --members m1
nova-sprint add --stream s1 --count 1 --one
nova-sprint start
nova-sprint tick
nova-sprint tick
nova-sprint take --as m1 --epoch 0
nova-sprint finish --as m1 s1-1.w1@1 --epoch 0 --report done
nova-sprint tick
nova-sprint read --as reader-a --begin --epoch 0
nova-sprint read --as reader-a --ok --epoch 0
nova-sprint tick
nova-sprint merge --stream s1 --batch 1
```

A twin beats every member and reader at every verb, so `m1` is up after the
first tick. Nothing runs between commands: tick by hand with `nova-sprint
tick`. `run`, `inbox --wait` and `where --watch` are refused. A card's move is
queued until the next tick prints `MOVED drain`; the tick after `merge`
completes its move to landed. The flow's output shows results, moves (`MOVED`),
refusals with reasons (`REFUSED`, on stderr), and the sprint's summary
(`landed/all percent -> ETA ...`).
[TESTS.md](TESTS.md#nova-sprint) carries the exact transcript through `merge`;
`cmd/nova-sprint/firstrun_test.go` runs it line by line.

Every store verb takes `--redis <addr>` (else `NOVA_SPRINT_REDIS`, then
`NOVA_REDIS_ADDR`, then the address `seat login` recorded), `--actor <name>` (else `NOVA_SPRINT_ACTOR`; no default — a
verb that writes wants one), `--op <id>` (the same id again returns the recorded
result), `--json` and `--max <n>` (listed items; 0 is all). The coordinator's
verbs are the coordinator's alone (the first `init` names it: `--coordinator`,
else the actor); `take`, `finish`, `read`, `fleet beat` and `friend beat` are the
workers', whose actor is the member, reader or friend named; `merge` and `ci`
are reports; `tick`, `run` and `friend clean` are the machine's. Reads need no
actor except `inbox --read`, which moves the coordinator's cursor. A set is
ids, a stream, a column, `--max n` (`--limit` is an alias), or an inbox group:
`--group <id>`, the id `inbox` prints, with `--expect <n>` the size it printed,
which refuses a group that has changed. `nova-sprint help <verb>` (or
`<verb> -h`) prints one verb's usage, flags and exit codes; `nova-sprint help
<group>` (fleet, friend, reader, goal, stream) prints one group's.

### The seat's store login

`nova-sprint seat login --store <secrets dir> --as <seat> --key <keyfile> --secret <NAME> --user <redis user> --redis <addr>` records the store login in `~/.config/nova-sprint/login.json` (or under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`), mode 0600: the address, the user and where the password is in nova-secrets, never the password, and only once the secret resolves. After it, `nova-sprint <verb>` typed bare reaches that store as that user, the password read in the verb's own process through nova-secrets' checks, with no `nova-secrets exec` wrapper; `--redis`, `NOVA_SPRINT_REDIS`/`NOVA_REDIS_ADDR` and `NOVA_SPRINT_REDIS_USER` still win. `seat login --check` prints `SEAT LOGIN file=… redis=… user=… … resolves=yes|no` (exit 1 on no), the password never shown; `seat logout` removes the record. A recorded secret that does not resolve is refused naming the file and the remedy, never dialed without a password. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md#the-seats-store-login).

### The sprint backup

`nova-sprint backup --file <path>` writes the store to a new file (owner-only; an existing file is refused, never overwritten), reads it back against its SHA-256, restores it into a twin and compares it with the store, and scans it for secret-shaped text. A file that fails any step is removed. On success it prints `BACKUP OK file=<path> sha256=<hex> bytes=<n> keys=<n> cards=<n> restored=twin compared=<document+counts|counts> secrets=none`; a refusal names the failed step and, for a secret, the lines (never the value). It runs on the store's host for a Redis, and on any twin (`--redis mem:<file>`) with no server. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md#sprint-backup-verb).

### A card re-cut as its twin

A card re-cut under a new id is its old card's twin: `add --stream s1 lint-pkg-cairn-tb
--brief-file lint-pkg-cairn-tb.md --replaces lint-pkg-cairn-t` admits the twin, makes
every waiting card that needed the old id need the twin instead (`card <dependent>` shows
the new need), drops the old card `replaced by lint-pkg-cairn-tb`, and raises no "blocked
on something dropped" judgment, in one step. Where the drop and the add were made apart,
`relink lint-pkg-cairn-t lint-pkg-cairn-tb` re-points the edges and answers the blocked
judgments of that pair. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md) section 2, "A
card replaced by its twin".

### Role views: what a model reads instead of the dashboard

The owner, 2026-10-04: "i'd rather you hit this vs. hitting my dashboard which is for human
eyes". `nova-sprint view coordinator` is everything that needs the seat now, ranked by the
cards behind each item: open judgments, notes addressed to the coordinator, alarms (the
machine stopped, the fleet idle, nothing ready, a review or merge backlog, a stream stopped),
sentinels reached, and friends and machines that need a look, each with `next`, the exact
command that acts on it. `nova-sprint view worker --as <member|friend>` is one worker's cards
in order (brief, BASE, PATHS, deadline, attempt), its next step and its results not landed.
Both are reads, `--json` (schema 1), compact for the tokens a model pays: only what needs
action (`--all` adds every machine's and friend's row), a summary line first, and a `cursor`
that `--since <cursor>` takes to leave out what the last read showed unchanged:

```sh
nova-sprint view coordinator                 # the summary and up to 19 items, then cursor=
nova-sprint view coordinator --json --since <the cursor the last read printed>
nova-sprint view worker --as m1 --json
curl -s --compressed http://<tailnet address>:<port>/api/view/coordinator
curl -s --compressed 'http://<tailnet address>:<port>/api/view/worker?as=<name>'
```

The sprint's server (`run --listen`) serves them read-only at `/api/view/coordinator` and
`/api/view/worker?as=<name>`. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md), section 11,
"Role views".

### A worker's own view: the dashboard's pull routes

`dashboard` serves the page on `--listen` (default `127.0.0.1:7390`) and, on listeners of
their own, the pull routes on `--pull` (default `127.0.0.1:7395`; `none` for either serves
nothing there): `curl -s http://<tailnet address>:7395/friend/<name>` is one friend's view
as plain text, a line an item (the sprint line, her friends-table row, a line per card
dealt to her: id, stream, state, how long, the time to its deadline, the branch; then the
open judgments on them); `/machine/<name>` is a fleet row's; `/team` is every friend and
the cards she holds; `/api/team`, `/api/friend/<name>`,
`/api/machine/<name>` and `/api/sprint` are JSON; `/events`, `/events/friend/<name>` and
`/events/machine/<name>` push each new copy as server-sent events. All of it is read-only,
no-store, carries the copy's time in `Sprint-At`, and comes from one copy of `where --json
--cards` read at most once a second however many pull. An unknown name is a 404 of one
line. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md), the dashboard.

### A provider out of funds

The owner, 2026-10-03: "provider out of funds should never be a mystery failure." `run` reads
each provider's balance every 10 minutes through the seat's key in its environment
(`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for openrouter; opencode publishes no balance and reads `unknown`) and
prints a `BALANCE` line. A provider out of credit by a take it refused is rested until a
payment is seen (a balance read higher than the read before it, or than the balance at the
refusal) or `funded`: a balance over zero that is not higher never ends it. One out of credit by
a balance at zero is rested until a balance over zero; one low on funds, a balance not over an
hour of its spend, until the balance is over it. One judgment of the provider says which (`a
payment is the owner's`). `where --json` carries the `providers` table (balance, spend an hour,
state) and `routes` each route's `balance=`. When every provider is out of credit, the tick
stops the machine (`machine: STOPPED (every provider is out of credit)`) and `start` is refused
until one is paid; a provider low on funds never stops it. `funded <provider> --reason <text>`
says one was paid. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md), "A provider out of funds".

### Answered by rule

The run loop's tick answers the mechanical judgments itself, by rule, and records each as
`answered by rule <name>` on the log and on the card (`rule_answer`): work came back
failed is redealt on the next route of its tier, and the second failure on a tier goes a
tier up (flash, pro, heavy, then a friend's card); a card at its bound goes a tier up; a
work card past its deadline is waited 30 minutes once when it made progress in the last 10,
else returned and dealt again; a stream stopped on a conflict in a file no ledger owns has
the card returned, the stream resumed and the card redone on the current tip; the same
finding twice marks the card a brief defect and leaves it to you; and land gates a red base
again after 2 and 5 minutes before the third failure stops the stream with the error. A
reader's finding stays yours. `nova-sprint rules` prints what the rules would answer now and
Xoff, and nova-config's sprint row turns single ones off: `nova-config sprint set
--answer_rules_off late,conflict`, then `nova-config apply`. The contract is
[SPEC-SPRINT.md section 8](SPEC-SPRINT.md#answered-by-rule).

### The fleet is idle

When the fleet works under half its width for 5 minutes while cards wait, the run loop's
tick pushes you one note, `the fleet is idle`: `fleet 4/68: 311 behind 21 drop-blocked
judgments (oldest 1h50m); 89 behind md-secrets (a card reached its bound, 40m)`, every
waiting card traced to the root of its chain and the roots named by the cards behind
them; once an episode, and `the fleet is working again` when it recovers. `run
--idle-alarm=false` turns it off. The contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md section 14](SPEC-SPRINT.md#the-fleet-is-idle).

### Answering the routine judgments

`nova-sprint answer` answers the routine judgments (a reader found it
broken, work came back failed, blocked on something dropped, stalled, a conflict,
past its deadline, cannot ask, ready to accept, a card at its bound) by
nova-decide's judgment decision, card by card: it applies the verb chosen when
its probability is at or above `decide_judgment_bar` (nova-config's sprint row,
empty by default: with no bar it applies nothing, records every decision and lists
what a bar would apply; `--bar` gives one for a run; 0.8 is a starting point measured on 100 of the coordinator's own judgments,
not an independent calibration), by the line the inbox prints for that card,
and lists the rest for you: every drop, everything under the bar, and a provider
refusal for want of payment, which it never asks about. It prints one table, a
row a card, and records every decision (`--record`, default
`~/nova-sprint/decide/judgment.jsonl`, its directory made 0700) with its outcome once the card lands, is dropped
or comes back. Each verb it applies carries the decision's op id (`--op
decide.<decision id>`), recorded as `applying` before the verb runs and `applied`
or `refused` after, so a pass stopped between the two is finished by the next
through the same op and nothing is applied twice. One ask may take `--timeout`
(60s by default); an ask past it, or one that fails, is that card's `failed` row,
nothing is applied for it, and the pass exits 1. `--dry-run` applies and records
nothing; `--every 60s` runs it as the seat's loop until the machine is STOPPED. Jev's key comes from `JEV_API_KEY`:
`nova-secrets exec --only JEV_API_KEY -- nova-sprint answer`. The
contract is [SPEC-SPRINT.md section 8](SPEC-SPRINT.md#answered-by-nova-decide)
and [SPEC-NOVA-DECIDE.md section 13](https://github.com/mas-bandwidth/nova-tools/blob/dev/docs/SPEC-NOVA-DECIDE.md#13-the-judgment-decision).

`add` under `JEV_API_KEY` (`nova-secrets exec --only JEV_API_KEY -- nova-sprint add
...`) asks nova-decide's brief decision of every card it names with a brief after its
own checks and before it writes, one deadline for the batch: one `BRIEF card=<id>
op=<card>@brief-<hex> p_converges= minutes= failed= uncalibrated=true recorded=` line
per card, recorded in `~/nova-sprint/decide/brief.jsonl` (or `--decide-record <file>`),
the op stored on the card for land and drop to attach its end. The decision is
uncalibrated: nova-config's `sprint` row `decide_brief_bar` stays empty, which reports
only, until the brief record's own outcomes support a bar
([SPEC-NOVA-DECIDE.md](https://github.com/mas-bandwidth/nova-tools/blob/dev/docs/SPEC-NOVA-DECIDE.md) section 14).

### install-canary-shadow-tick-r.w1: the shadow tick before a server swap

`nova-sprint tick --shadow` plans one tick on the store and applies nothing: the store is
opened read-only, every write a refusal, and each part's plan is printed (`SHADOW PLAN
<table>/<part> size= due=`, then `SHADOW TICK OK epoch= state= parts= size= took= wrote=nothing`;
`--json` prints the plan as one line). `nova-sprint server switch <binary>` runs `<binary> tick
--shadow --json` against the store first and refuses the swap, exit 1 with nothing changed and
the old server running, when the shadow exits non-zero, panics, misses `--tick-deadline`
(default 10s) or prints no plan; on a pass it switches and keeps the shadow's plan size and time
at `<target>.shadow.json`, beside the switch record. The contract is
[SPEC-SPRINT.md](SPEC-SPRINT.md) section 14, "install-canary-shadow-tick-r.w1".

### Exit codes

| exit | meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | done |
| 1 | failed or incomplete (including refused; `start` while every provider is out of credit) |
| 2 | usage, or a store that did not answer (`fleet sync --check`: there is drift) |
| 3 | unreadable config (`fleet sync`, `friend sync`, `friend clean`), missing friend rows (`friend sync`, `friend clean`), or a replaced binary (`run`, `dashboard`) |

### What it does not prove

A landed card records a completed flow: the worker reports done, the required
readers pass that head (one for flash, two distinct readers for pro), the tick
(or the coordinator's `accept`) queues it for merging, and the landing is
reported. These are recorded judgments, not a proof that the work is correct. A twin exercises that flow one command at a
time. It has no beats or ticks between commands, so it does not test fleet
timing, the `run` loop, `inbox --wait` or liveness. `finish` without `--head`,
then `merge`, records a landing without a push. The work table's cost column
is, per stream, the sum of its landed cards' total cost in US dollars — each
card's actual cost where one was priced, else its predicted one, `-` when
none was — so a total is a ledger of recorded spend, not a proof of it.


## nova-sprint card generate, template and lint

These were the nova-card binary, which is retired: `nova-card generate`,
`template` and `lint` now refuse with `nova-card <verb> moved to nova-sprint card
<verb>; run: nova-sprint card <verb> -h`, and so do `nova-sprint generate`,
`template` and `lint` typed bare. `nova-sprint card <id>` is still the read of one
card. The verbs write briefs on disk or read them and never the sprint store, so
they take no actor and a server named by `NOVA_SPRINT_SERVER` does not run them.
They are pre-alpha: not ready for production use.

```
nova-sprint card generate --from ledger --ledger <name> --repo-dir <dir> --out <dir> [--tier flash|pro] [--prefix <p>] [--minutes <n>] [--max <n>] [--base <branch>] [--repo <owner/name>] [--dry-run]
nova-sprint card generate --from findings --file <tsv> --out <dir> (--repo-dir <dir> | --repo <owner/name> --base <branch> --sha <40hex>) [--tier flash|pro] [--prefix <p>] [--minutes <n>] [--max <n>] [--dry-run]
nova-sprint card generate --from help --tool <name> [--tool <name>...] --out <dir> [--bin-dir <dir>] (--repo-dir <dir> | --repo --base --sha) [--tier flash|pro] [--prefix <p>] [--minutes <n>] [--max <n>] [--dry-run]
nova-sprint card lint --card <file> [--card <file>...]
nova-sprint card template
```

Writing many similar briefs by hand is easy to get wrong. `nova-sprint card generate` computes
paths from the source material, checks the generated cards, and lays out waves
and dependencies. You can then review the result and load it into the sprint.

The flow is three lines:

```sh
nova-sprint card generate --from ledger --ledger serial-tests --repo-dir ./repo --out ./cards
nova-sprint add --stream debt --brief-dir ./cards --allow-shared-paths
nova-sprint where
```

### First run

The included findings file is two files' worth of a reader's findings. No
checkout is needed when `--repo`, `--base` and `--sha` are given; with
`--repo-dir` the three are read off the checkout and every PATHS entry is
checked to exist in it:

```sh
nova-sprint card generate --from findings --file ./cmd/nova-sprint/testdata/findings.tsv --repo example/repo --base dev --sha 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 --out ./cards
nova-sprint card lint --card ./cards/finding-internal-bus-send.md
nova-sprint card lint --card ./cards/finding-cmd-nova-bus-main.md
```

`./cards` then holds one `.md` per card, its name the card's id, and a
`manifest.tsv` (id, file, test, wave, deps). [TESTS.md](TESTS.md#briefs-from-a-findings-file)
carries the transcript; `TestTheCardTranscriptRuns` in
`cmd/nova-sprint/cardverbs_test.go` runs it.

### Sources

`--from ledger --ledger <name>` reads one of internal/ci's ratchet ledgers from
the checkout: `serial-tests`, `slowwaits`, `sleeps-skips`, `fixed-waits`
(flash), `dead-code`, `namedpaths`, `transcripts`, `generality-fixtures` (pro).
One card per file the rows name; the card's PATHS are the file, its package's
test files and the ledger; its TEST is the class test that holds the ledger;
its task is the ledger's template with the rows substituted, and it says to
write the draft early and commit before any probe. `--from findings --file
<tsv>` reads `file:line`, finding, remedy, test columns (a header row is
skipped); one card per file, the first finding's test as TEST, a card with no
test named given the one it must write. `--from help --tool <name>` runs
`<name> help` and writes one card per tool: the lines over 100 characters,
the undefined terms and the examples that do not run as printed.

### Waves and dependencies

Cards of one ordinary ledger delete adjacent lines of one file and would
conflict at land, so odd cards are wave 1 and even cards wave 2, each wave 2
card depending on its wave 1 neighbours (`DEPENDS-ON`). A generated ledger
(SPEC-SPRINT.md section 7, the generality family) is regenerated by `land`, so
its cards are one wave with no dependency. Wave 1 cards of one ledger share its
path and neither needs the other, so the add wants `--allow-shared-paths`; the
`CARDS OK` line says `shared-paths=yes` when it does.

### What it refuses

Every brief is held to the lint `nova-sprint add` runs (the model lines, the
child rules under the default rule set, a tree card's steps), and past the add
to the typed header and the template's unfilled `<...>` lines, which the add
does not read, before anything is written (a sprint initialised with `--rules`
holds a brief to that file at the add); one red brief prints its
`LINT DRIFT card=<id> check=<check> line=<n>: <excerpt>` line and nothing is
written, exit 1. A PATHS entry that names nothing in `--repo-dir` is the same
refusal. An `--out` that already holds a brief is refused, exit 2. `--dry-run`
plans and lints, prints the manifest and the `CARDS OK` line with
`dry-run=yes`, and writes nothing.

### Exit codes

0 done; 1 a brief is red and nothing was written; 2 could not run.

### nova-card new: one brief from its parts

`nova-card new` is the one verb the nova-card binary still runs (it is not yet
a verb of `nova-sprint card`). It writes a hand-written card's brief from its
parts so no one types the skeleton: the header `nova-sprint add` reads, the
child paragraph, the `RULES.` lines of the default rule set, an `ATTRIBUTION.`
sentence, `THE TASK.` from the file, and STEP 1 to STEP 6 in the shape
`nova-sprint card generate` writes. The STEP 4 gate is built from `--gate`:
`go vet <pkgs>` and `go test -count=1 -timeout 600s <pkgs>`, then `gofmt -l`
on every changed Go file.

```
nova-card new <id> --repo <owner/name> --base <branch> --task-file <file> --paths <paths> [--shared <paths>] --test <test> --gate <pkgs> --tier <tier> [--needs <ids>] [--kind <kind>] [--minutes <n>] [--out <file>]
nova-card new --batch <tsv> --out <dir> [--repo <owner/name>] [--base <branch>] [--tier <tier>] [--gate <pkgs>] ...
```

```sh
nova-card new fix-x --repo owner/repo --base main --task-file task.txt --paths 'cmd/x/**' --test './cmd/x TestX' --gate './cmd/x/' --tier pro --out cards/fix-x.md
nova-sprint add --stream debt --brief-dir ./cards
```

The brief goes to stdout, or to `--out <file>` with a `CARD OK file=<file>`
line. `--batch <tsv>` writes one brief per row into `--out <dir>` (refused when
it already holds a brief) and prints `CARD <id> task=<how the task was read>`
per row, then `CARDS OK dir=<dir> cards=<n>`. The table is tab separated; blank
lines and `#` lines are skipped. A first row opening `id` is a header naming
the columns: `id`, `repo`, `base`, `task_file`, `task`, `paths`, `shared`,
`test`, `gate`, `tier`, `needs`; a column it does not know is refused. A
`task_file` cell is read as the task, and one that cannot be read is refused
naming the row and the path; a `task` cell is the task's text. With no header
the columns are id, task, paths, test, gate, tier, shared, needs, and the task
cell is read as a file when one is there and as the text otherwise, which the
`CARD` line says (`column 2 file <path>` or `column 2 inline`). An empty cell
takes the flag's value.

It refuses, exit 2 and nothing written, a missing part by its flag (`missing
--repo, --test`), a `--task-file` it cannot read, a tier that is not frontier,
heavy, pro or flash, a TEST the add would refuse, a `--gate` that is a command
rather than packages, and a batch id named twice. Every brief is held to the
lint `nova-sprint add` runs before a byte is written; a red one prints its
`LINT DRIFT` line, exit 1.


## nova-work

Bring issue content into a local file so you and your AIs can inspect it
together. This checkout labels the separate `nova-work` command pre-alpha;
the v1.0.0 product includes the work tree.

Every issue of every repository of a GitHub organization in one tree file, with
each issue's full contents, and a check that the file holds exactly what GitHub
holds. The design is [SPEC-WORK-V1.md](SPEC-WORK-V1.md); this section is how to
use it. It reads GitHub only (no GitLab, no Gitea), never writes to GitHub (the
seam refuses any GraphQL document that is not a query), and captures the fields
SPEC-WORK-V1 section 1.3 lists, not reactions or other timeline events.

**Try it with no login.** `nova-work verify -h` prints the tree's grammar and a
minimal tree. Save that tree as `a.lisp`, copy it to `b.lisp` with
`:archived true`, and run `nova-work verify --tree a.lisp --against b.lisp`: one
`VERIFY DRIFT ... field=archived` line under `VERIFY FAIL`, exit 1. The same
file against itself is `VERIFY OK ... differences=0`, exit 0.

**First run against GitHub.** Needs `gh auth status` to pass and one repository
you can read: export `ORG` and `REPO`, then run the three lines of the banner's
`example:` block in a scratch directory (a dry run, the import to
`./tree.lisp`, the verify). The executed transcript of that sitting, with every
line of output, is in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md#nova-work).

**Output.** One result per run: `IMPORT OK`, `VERIFY OK`, `VERIFY FAIL` (exit 1,
the differences as `VERIFY MISSING`, `EXTRA` or `DRIFT` lines, values quoted),
or `<VERB> REFUSED: <why>; run: <next command>` (exit 2). `--json` prints the
same result as one JSON object.

### import

Reads every issue of `--org` (or of each `--repo`) through your `gh` login,
read-only, and writes one local tree file, `--out`, only after the encoded tree
has read back equal to what was fetched. `--dry-run` is not offline: it reads
GitHub exactly as the import does (every issue, the same calls), checks the
round trip, and writes nothing. A dry run costs what the import costs:
`IMPORT PLAN` names `est_calls`, and `--max-calls` (default 1500) refuses a plan
past it before any issue is read.

### verify

Reads the tree and GitHub again and writes nothing: zero differences is
`VERIFY OK ... differences=0`, the receipt that the tree holds what GitHub
holds. `--against <tree>` puts a second tree file where GitHub stands and reads
no network at all.

## Sprint-program design commands

This checkout also exposes `nova-sprint work repos`, `work issues`,
`work roadmap`, `work export`, and `work import`. Their durable
sprint-program implementation is not built: they exit with a refusal and
read or write neither a tree nor Redis. They are distinct from the working
GitHub-mirror `nova-work import` and `verify` commands above. See the
[design and implementation status](../internal/work/NOTE.md) before using
those names in an integration.
